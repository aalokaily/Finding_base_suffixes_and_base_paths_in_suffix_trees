# Finding_base_suffixes_and_base_paths_in_suffix_trees
Suffix trees are fundamental data structure in stringology. We introduce two algorithms that index all strings/suffixes under all internal nodes in suffix tree in linear time and space. The first algorithms index all string under each internal node in suffix tree using the concept of base suffixes; while, the second algorithm index all paths between each internal node in suffix tree its desandant internal nodes. These indexes can contribute in resolving several strings problems such as DNA sequence analysis and approximate pattern matching problems. The full details of both algorithms/indexes are are provided at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.25.465764v3.
